1. When deleting from a frame after selecting it:
	-The Frames on Screen doesn't match up the frames in images 
	 array. (Fixed)
	
2. Playback doesn't show the last frame when playing.(completely
 sorry :{ )
	Details: When I changed the array to an object, the length 
			 function no longer works since it does not exist for 
			 an object type. Therefore unable to loop through object

		(fixed)

Curve line tool, is bugged.

-		POSSIBLE FIXES					 -
==================================================================
1.Do not remove div for playback. Add listener to click outside the playback div after play.
	(can add close button on playback)

2.Change scope of undo (global). Allow for undo of all functions.
